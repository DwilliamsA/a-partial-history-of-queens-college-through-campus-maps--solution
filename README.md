## Before You Start

**<u>*Before doing anything at all to this repo, make sure to checkout your personalized branch first.*</u>**

Prepare your project’s scaffold before working, spending some time understanding how all the included files interact with each other.

1. Download and install the typefaces IBM Plex Sans [https://ibm.github.io/type/](https://ibm.github.io/type/) and Font Awesome 5, the free regular version [https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/use-on-desktop](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/use-on-desktop). Otherwise, when you launch `desktop.sketch`, Sketch will generate a “missing fonts” error in the upper right hand corner of the window.

2. The only images you’ll need are in the `img` folder. Also, don’t move them.

3. Use the reset CSS document.

4. 

## Rules

* The navigation along the left must remain fixed.
